The intranet allows the researchers and managers of the network to share content with each other *privately*. Content and users are organized in different groups, and only members of that group can access and create content in that group.

Note: if your site has an intranet, it will be often accessible at `intranet.yoursite.eu`.

## Tutorials

### Creating a group

* Log in with your account, and click `Create Content` > `Group` in the top right bar.
* Provide a title for the group, a path, the type of group (leave "Private group") and a short description, and click "Save"
* The dashboard will provide an overview of the activity within that group, and the other icons in the top show the features this group has enabled by default. To check out more features within this group, click `Settings` > `Customize Features` and enable new features, select a group image and a default color for that group.

### Managing members

* In your group, click the "Members tab" and then `Add user`
* Select the username, email and provide a personal welcome message. The systen will send out an email with a login link and have the user automatically registered in the groups you select.
* The new member now shows up in the Member directory, and can be promoted to administrator of that group if wanted. The administrator has the possibility to change the features within that group.

### Folders

* The folder feature of a group allows members of a group to maintain a folder structure with files.
* To add a folder, click `Create Folder` and fill out the fields. Optionally create any subfolders as well.
* You can batch upload a number of files if they are together in a zip file. Click `Attach files to this folder`, choose the file you want to upload and click Save.
* To edit an existing folder, click `Edit` from the top left bar.
* To edit or delete an existing file, use the icons that are shown next to the file. You can also move files to different folders.

### Notifications

With every update you can decide to notify all or a selected group of members of that group. At the bottom of the content adding pages, select the people you'd like to notify about your changes. They will receive an email with your update.
